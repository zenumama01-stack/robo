    These can be enabled by configurating the session with
    `"include": ["item.input_audio_transcription.logprobs"]`. Each entry in the
    array corresponds a log probability of which token would be selected for this
    chunk of transcription. This can help to identify if it was possible there were
    multiple valid options for a given chunk of transcription.
