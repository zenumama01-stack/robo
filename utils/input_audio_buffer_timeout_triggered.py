class InputAudioBufferTimeoutTriggered(BaseModel):
    """Returned when the Server VAD timeout is triggered for the input audio buffer.
    This is configured
    with `idle_timeout_ms` in the `turn_detection` settings of the session, and it indicates that
    there hasn't been any speech detected for the configured duration.
    The `audio_start_ms` and `audio_end_ms` fields indicate the segment of audio after the last
    model response up to the triggering time, as an offset from the beginning of audio written
    to the input audio buffer. This means it demarcates the segment of audio that was silent and
    the difference between the start and end values will roughly match the configured timeout.
    The empty audio will be committed to the conversation as an `input_audio` item (there will be a
    `input_audio_buffer.committed` event) and a model response will be generated. There may be speech
    that didn't trigger VAD but is still detected by the model, so the model may respond with
    something relevant to the conversation or a prompt to continue speaking.
    Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer at the time the
    timeout was triggered.
    Millisecond offset of audio written to the input audio buffer that was after the
    playback time of the last model response.
