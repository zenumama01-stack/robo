    """Returned when a Response is done streaming.
    Always emitted, no matter the
    final state. The Response object included in the `response.done` event will
    include all output Items in the Response but will omit the raw audio data.
    Clients should check the `status` field of the Response to determine if it was successful
    (`completed`) or if there was another outcome: `cancelled`, `failed`, or `incomplete`.
    A response will contain all output items that were generated during the response, excluding
    any audio content.
